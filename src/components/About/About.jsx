      <p>I'm Sophia, a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in computer science and web technologies. As a Business Information Technology graduate from Red River College Polytechnic, my education has equipped me with both the technical expertise and problem-solving skills to bring ideas to life. I gained hands-on experience during my work term at ACE Project Space, where I worked as a web developer, strengthening my skills in Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB. I specialize in building full-stack applications and creating dynamic, user-friendly websites using tools like React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. Alongside technical abilities, I developed essential soft skills, including teamwork, leadership, and communication, and am always eager to collaborate on innovative projects. Letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together!</p>
